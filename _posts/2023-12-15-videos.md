This is an example post with videos. It supports local video files.

<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

It does also support embedding videos from different sources. Here are some examples:
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path= "https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxs_HYw_mLk?si=-K1pYyyPGi6gsDfk" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNQXAC9IVRw" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
